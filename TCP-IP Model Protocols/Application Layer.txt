Application Layer is processing in websites mostly and the protocols example are
HTTP, DNS, TELNET, SMTP, SNMP, RDP This is the login process host for example
facebook login basically something to save accout data it receives login request
hackers learn this because they exploit this vulnerability spot to hsck accounts using attack methods such as
Bruteforce, Dictionary Attack, and more by understanding how to exploit this log in page
and measure login security a hidden code that probably stores data and finds the right or compatible passwords
to that account or log in information we can intercept this using burpsuite interceptor
before strong password or high tech log in security measures were created
hackers used to exploit this vulnerability spot to steal money or sell Data
but into this day hackers can still do this but in a hard way possible and trying to bypass this with various of tools.
